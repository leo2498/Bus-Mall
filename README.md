Assignment overview and code demo
We start a new project today! Let's take a look at a demo to generate random pictures, and talk about how it is set it up and finish getting it built.

The goal for this week is to have this new project completed by Thursday morning, so it'll have to come together quickly. There's big pieces added on each of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

Let's make a list of the steps needed to get things built today and strategize how we will dissect and conquer the problem domain while keeping a priority toward user experience.
